#. # Accesskeys are defined by prefixing the letter that is to be used for the
#. # accesskey with an ampersand (e.g. &).
#. # Do not replace $(^NameDA) or $(^Name) with a custom string.
#. # Do not change $(^NameDA) to $(^Name) or $(^Name) to $(^NameDA). NameDA allows
#. # Name to contain an ampersand (e.g. DA stands for double ampersand) and
#. # prevents the letter following the ampersand being used as an accesskey.
#. # You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string
#. # from en-US contains a \n.
