Updated Serbian l10n.

Correcting the encoding problems with the windows installer.
Made several files convertible to CP1251 --- by eliminating the correct
Serbian quotes („‟) and replacing them with incorrect quotes ("") for
Serbian language.  Also wrote a script to check whether the output
files conform to the CP1251 code page, to eliminate this error in the future.
