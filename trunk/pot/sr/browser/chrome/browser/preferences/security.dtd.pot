# LOCALIZATION NOTE (tellMaybeForgery.label, tellMaybeAttackSite.label):
# The methods by which forged (phished) and attack sites will be detected by
# phishing providers will vary from human review to machine-based heuristics to a
# combination of both, so it's important that these strings and
# useDownloadedList.label convey the meaning "suspected" (and not something like
# "known").
